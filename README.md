CS241 - Data Structures
=====

This course is a continuation of CS 141: Computation Problem Solving. The major topics of the course
include data abstraction, data structures, and algorithms. Common data structures and algorithms, including
arrays, lists, maps, stacks, queues, hash tables, trees, heaps, searching, sorting, and recursion, will be
covered. The implementation of abstract data structures using classes gives this course a significant
programming component.

The repository has assignments 1 to 6. Always checkout the latest code, in case there are corrections made to the test cases or specifications. For each assignment, a template for the class and a unit test will be provided.
