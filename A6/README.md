This project will teach you how to use a simple heuristic in order to
efficiently search for a path through a map and avoiding obstacles.

Refer to the following guide: [A star for
Beginners](http://www.policyalmanac.org/games/aStarTutorial.htm)

Overview of the steps are as follows:

- Create a PriorityQueue class in the astar package
- Create a pathfinding routine in astar package
- Make sure the web framework can find your routines and classes
- run: python run.py

You may modify any source file if you want to customize your application to
work differently from my design. However, to make things easier, I took my
working implementation, deleted some source code in certain functions and ask
that you implement those sections yourself.
