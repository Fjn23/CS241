A-star Pathfinding Algorithm
=============================

This project will teach you how to use a simple heuristic in order to
efficiently search for a path through a map and avoiding obstacles.

- Create a PriorityQueue class in the astar package
- Create a pathfinding routine in astar package
- Make sure the web framework can find your routines and classes
- run: python run.py

PriorityQueue
----------------

The priority queue keeps the minimum element available. You should implement the 
*insert* and the *remove* functions.
